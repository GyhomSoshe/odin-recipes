    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A popular French beef stew with red wine and vegetables. Better if cooked a day beforehand.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For 6 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1,6 kg braising steak</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>small bunch thyme</li>
        <li>1 bottle of cheap red wine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>small knob butter</li>
        <li>3 large or 6 normal carrots</li>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>4 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>400g muschroom</li>
        <li>300g bacon lardons</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the braising steak, cut into large chunks, into a large bowl with 3 bay leaves, a small bunch of thyme, a bottle of red wine and some pepper, then cover and leave in the fridge 6h.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.</li>
        <li>Place a colander over another large bowl and strain the marinated meat, keeping the wine.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan, then brown the meat in batches, transferring to a plate once browned. When all the meat is browned, pour a little wine into the now-empty frying pan and bubble to release any caramelised bits from the pan.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large casserole and fry 3 large or 6 normal carrots, cut into large chunks, and 2 roughly chopped onions until they start to colour. Stir in 3 tbsp plain flour for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Add the beef and any juices, the wine from the frying pan and the rest of the wine and herbs. Season and bring to a simmer. Give everything a good stir, then cover.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the oven and bake for 2 hrs until the meat is really tender. Cool. Will freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>To serve, defrost completely overnight in the fridge if frozen, then place on a low heat to warm through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a small knob of butter in a frying pan and add 300g bacon lardons. Sizzle for about 10 mins until the bacon starts to crisp and the onions soften and colour.</li>
        <li>Add the halved mushrooms and fry for another 5 mins, then stir everything into the stew and heat for 10 mins more. </li>
    </ol>
