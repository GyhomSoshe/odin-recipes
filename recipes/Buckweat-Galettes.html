    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are eaten all year long in France, more usually in the western regions.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150 g buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>350 ml/g cold water</li>
        <li>big pinch fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg Large</li> 
        <li>butter to grease the frying pan </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk the buckwheat flour and half of the water to a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and the remaining water and whisk again until you have a reasonably thin batter.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and place in the fridge to rest for (preferably) a minimum of 4 hours. This will ensure the flour is fully hydrated.</li>
        <li>Bring the batter back to room temperature before cooking.</li>
        <li>When ready to make the galettes, re-whisk the galette batter until even. Keep the whisk handy, beating again every couple of pancakes to ensure the consistency remains stable.</li>
        <li>Heat the pancake frying pan until hot. Using a thick wad of kitchen paper, carefully rub a little butter around the pan so there remains only a light oil smear on the base.</li>
        <li>Ladle or pour a little batter into the pan and quickly swirl to spread into a large thin circle. Fill in any gaps, keeping the batter thin.</li>
        <li>Cook for approximately 40 to 60 seconds until the edges come away from the pan. Do not press the galette down during cooking. Gently ease a spatula under the galette and when it can be moved freely in the pan, flip it over to cook the other side. The top of the pancake should now have a 'lacy' texture from the formation of air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Cook the other side of the pancake for a further 40 to 60 seconds (approx) until it has gently browned underneath.</li>
        <li>Remove the galette to a plate and cover with a clean tea towel.</li>
        <li>Freshly butter the base of the pan as previously (and wipe out any crumbs left behind). Then cook the next pancake as before.</li>
        <li>Continue until all the pancake batter has been used.</li> 
    </ol>
