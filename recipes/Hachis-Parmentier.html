    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another way to bake masched potatoes, this time over grinded meat.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1kg ground beef </li>
        <li>900 g floury potatoes </li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 medium garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>a handful fresh parsley chopped</li>
        <li>a handful cheese grated</li>
        <li>125 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li></ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and dice them into small bits. Add them to a large casserole, add a dash of salt and lots of water, boil them.</li>
        <li>Cook until tender and then drain them. In the meantime peel the onion and garlic. Add them to another casserole together with 2 tablespoons of butter and the bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Place it over medium heat and gently fry the onion for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season with a pinch of pepper, salt and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Stir well and then add the minced beef.</li>
        <li>Break the mince up a bit and stir well again. Put a lid on the pan and let the beef cook for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the freshly chopped parsley.</li>
        <li>Take the beef off the heat and let it cool a little. In the meantime add the drained potatoes back to the casserole you cooked them in. Add the rest of the unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>Mash the potatoes up. Season with a good dash of pepper, salt and nutmeg. Pour in the whole milk.</li>
        <li>Mash them again until creamy. Then spread a little layer of the potato mash in a baking dish (this will absorb any juice coming from the cooked beef).</li>
        <li>Top with the cooked beef mince.</li>
        <li>Finish with the rest of the mashed potatoes. Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake the parmentier in a preheated over <strong>at 200Â°C for 20 minutes</strong> or until the crust is golden brown. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
